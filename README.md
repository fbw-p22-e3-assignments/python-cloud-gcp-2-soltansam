Below you can find a few task where you will need to use **Compute Engine** service.

> All tasks assume that you have your **Google Cloud Platform** account ready.

#

## Task 1: Create Compute Engine instance

Follow the requirements:
- should be the least expensive 
- should have **PIP** installed 
- should be **Linux**
- you should be able to SSH to it

#

## Task 2: SSH to your instance

You can do it directly from your Google Cloud Platform Console.


#

## Task 3: Check Python version

Assuming you are SSH to your instance, now you can check Python version using the command:

```console
python3 --version
```

#

## Task 4: Remove your Compute Engine instance

Make sure you removed your instance after the exercise.
